# Note Taker

## Description

- I create this basic text-editor app to practices working with webpack and workbox to create a functional PWA.
- The app itself is a simple text-editor with basic syntax highlighting that will persist date entered using the indexeddb.
- Being a PWA the app can be installed on your local machine and used offline.
